NBA Data Engineering Project 🚀 End-to-End ETL Pipeline | Data Analysis | Cloud Integration 📌 Project Overview This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering workflow using NBA data. The dataset includes player statistics, team histories, game schedules, and performance metrics, making it perfect for ETL pipelines, SQL analysis, and cloud-based data engineering.

📊 Dataset Description The dataset consists of multiple CSV files and an SQL database containing:

🏀 Games.csv - Historical game results. 📅 LeagueSchedule24_25.csv - The upcoming NBA season schedule. 📂 NBA_Database.sql - A structured database with relational tables. 📈 PlayerStatistics.csv - Individual player performance data. 🔍 Players.csv - Player details (name, team, position, etc.). 📊 TeamHistories.csv - Historical team performance. 📌 TeamStatistics.csv - Team stats like wins, losses, and efficiency. ⚙️ Technologies Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, PySpark) SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite) ETL Pipeline (Apache Airflow) Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Redshift, Athena) Data Visualization (Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn) FastAPI (for building an API to serve NBA insights) 📂 Project Structure
